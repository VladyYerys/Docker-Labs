# Docker-Labs
You learn faster and better when you learn by doing. With that in mind, this course has been designed to teach core Docker fundamentals and features through a 100% hands-on experience. To accomplish this, our Training Architects have hand-selected a set of the best Docker Hands-on Labs we have to offer.

Everything in this course will be inside of a real Linux environment provisioned with whatever needed through our hands-on lab and Cloud Playground platform.

There's no reason to wait; learn by doing today!
